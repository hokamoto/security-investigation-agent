name: unanswerable_authenticated_users
question: "For akamai.fab34.com between 2025-12-03T00:00:00Z and 2025-12-08T00:00:00Z, which authenticated usernames were targeted by the attacks, and how many attacks did each user account receive?"
expected_answer: "This question cannot be answered because the available WAF and CDN logs do not contain authenticated username information. The logs include client IPs, paths, attack types, and HTTP responses, but do not track which specific user accounts were logged in or targeted. To answer this question would require application-level authentication logs."
expected_methods:
  - "Must correctly identify that the question is unanswerable with available data"
  - "Should set is_answerable=False in the investigation plan"
  - "Should explain that WAF/CDN logs do not contain authenticated username information"
  - "Should NOT attempt to infer usernames from paths, IPs, User-Agent, or other fields"
  - "Should NOT fabricate or guess user information"
  - "May suggest that application-level authentication logs would be needed"
