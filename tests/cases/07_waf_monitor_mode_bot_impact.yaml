question: "For akamai.fab34.com between 2025-12-03T00:00:00Z and 2025-12-08T00:00:00Z, identify the IP address with the most WAF monitor-mode Bot detections. Then analyze the CDN logs to see what HTTP status codes their requests received."
expected_answer: "The top monitor-mode Bot attacker is 54.241.100.9 with 96 WAF detections (appliedAction=monitor). CDN log analysis shows: 36 requests (27.3%) received 200 OK responses, 84 requests (63.6%) received 404 Not Found, and 12 requests (9.1%) received 403 Forbidden."
expected_methods:
  - "MUST use 2-round planning: Round 1 identifies top monitor-mode Bot attacker, Round 2 analyzes CDN outcomes for that IP"
  - "Round 1 query MUST filter by appliedAction = 'monitor' AND has(attackTypes, 'Bot')"
  - "Round 1 query MUST use GROUP BY clientIP and ORDER BY count() DESC to find top attacker"
  - "Round 2 query MUST use WHERE cliIP = '<discovered_ip>' on CDN table"
  - "Round 2 query MUST use GROUP BY statusCode to analyze response distribution"
  - "Should calculate success rate: count of 200 responses vs total CDN requests"
